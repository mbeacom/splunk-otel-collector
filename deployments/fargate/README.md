# AWS Fargate Deployment
Familiarity with AWS Fargate (Fargate) is assumed. Consult the 
[User Guide for AWS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/what-is-fargate.html) for further reading.

Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that the [Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector)
(Collector) is deployed to an ECS Task in a **sidecar** container alongside monitored applications.

Applies to Collector release v0.30.0 and above. See the Docker image repository
[here](https://quay.io/repository/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector?tab=tags).


## Default Configuration
The default configuration file is located at `/etc/otel/collector/fargate_config.yaml`
in the Collector image. See 
[here](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/blob/main/cmd/otelcol/config/collector/fargate_config.yaml)
for its contents and 
[here](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/blob/main/cmd/otelcol/Dockerfile)
for the Collector image Dockerfile. Note that the default metrics receivers are `hostmetrics`
and `smartagent/ecs-metadata`.

Default configuration steps in the container definition for the Collector:
- Map the endpoint ports in the default configuration file (i.e. `13133`, `6060`,
  `55679`, `14250`, `6832`, `6831`, `14268`, `8888`, `7276`, `9943`, `9411`, `9080`).
- Assign the default configuration file path to environment variable `SPLUNK_CONFIG`.
- Assign a list of metrics you want excluded to environment variable `METRICS_TO_EXCLUDE`.
- Assign a list of images whose metrics you want excluded to environment variable `IMAGES_TO_EXCLUDE`.

## Custom Configuration
For the Collector pick up your custom configuration, you need to assign the path to your custom
configuration file to environment variable `SPLUNK_CONFIG` in the container definition for
the Collector. In Fargate, this means having your custom configuration file in a volume
attached to the task and assigning the path to `SPLUNK_CONFIG`.

### ecs_observer
Add extension
[Amazon Elastic Container Service Observer](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/observer/ecsobserver#amazon-elastic-container-service-observer)
(ecsobserver or ecs_observer) to your custom configuration to discover application metrics
targets. The `ecs_observer` can discover targets in running tasks, filtered by service names,
task definitions and container labels. The `ecs_observer` is currently limited to discovering
Prometheus targets and requires the read-only permissions below. Add the permissions to the task role
by adding them to a customer-managed policy attached to the task role.
```text
ecs:List*
ecs:Describe*
```

In the example below, the `ecs_observer` is configured to find Prometheus targets in
cluster `lorem-ipsum-cluster` of region `us-west-2` where the task arn pattern is 
`^arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:906383545488:task-definition/lorem-ipsum-task:[0-9]+$`,
and write the results in file `/etc/ecs_sd_targets.yaml`. The `prometheus` receiver is
configured to read targets from the results file. Note that the values for `access_token`
and `realm` are read from environment variables `SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `SPLUNK_REALM`
respectively, which must be specified in the container definition.

```yaml
extensions:
  ecs_observer:
    refresh_interval: 10s
    cluster_name: 'lorem-ipsum-cluster'
    cluster_region: 'us-west-2'
    result_file: '/etc/ecs_sd_targets.yaml'
    task_definitions:
      - arn_pattern: "^arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:906383545488:task-definition/lorem-ipsum-task:[0-9]+$"
        metrics_ports: [9113]
        metrics_path: /metrics
receivers:
  signalfx:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'lorem-ipsum-nginx'
          scrape_interval: 10s
          file_sd_configs:
            - files:
                - '/etc/ecs_sd_targets.yaml'
processors:
  batch:
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [ecs]
    override: false    
exporters:
  signalfx:
    access_token: ${SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN}
    realm: ${SPLUNK_REALM}
service:
  extensions: [ecs_observer]
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [prometheus]
      processors: [batch, resourcedetection]
      exporters: [signalfx]
```
In a sidecar deployment the discovered targets must be within the task in which the Collector
container is running. Note that the task arn pattern in the example above 
restricts the `ecs_observer` to discover targets in running revisions of task `lorem-ipsum-task`.
This means that the `ecs_observer` will discover targets outside the task in which the Collector is
running when multiple revisions of task `lorem-ipsum-task` are running. One way
to solve this is to use the complete task arn as shown below. This however adds the headache of
updating the configuration to keep pace with task revisions.

```yaml
...
     - arn_pattern: "^arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:906383545488:task-definition/lorem-ipsum-task:3$"
...
```

### Direct Configuration
Since access to the filesystem is not readily available in Fargate, it may be convenient to
specify the configuration YAML directly at the commandline using environment variable
`SPLUNK_CONFIG_YAML`. The steps are:
- Create a parameter in the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for your custom configuration
  YAML.
- Use the `ValueFrom` feature to assign the parameter to environment variable
  `SPLUNK_CONFIG_YAML` in the container definition for the Collector.
- Add policy `AmazonSSMReadOnlyAccess` to the task role in order for the task to have
  read access to the Parameter Store.

### Standalone Container
The `ecs_observer` is capable of scanning for targets in the entire cluster in a given region.
This allows for the Collector to run in a task separate from the monitored application and
collect telemetry data.
